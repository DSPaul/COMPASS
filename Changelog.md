## COMPASS v1.7.0 (10 March 2024)

### New Features

- IMPORT & EXPORT are here in the form of `Satchels`! In this new update you can:
  - Export collections to a new .satchel file to share with your friends. Exports can include:
    - the tags from a collection
    - the items in the collection (such as books and maps) including their metadata, cover art and even the files referenced by those items such as pdf's.
    - your settings for that collection such as which file types to exclude from import
  - Import those .satchel files to merge all of its content into one of your existing collections or add it as brand new collection.
  - Both during import and export, you can pick and choose which tags, books and settings you want to keep using a user friendly wizard. You can access this new feature by using the new "Import" and "Export" options near the collections at the top.
    - If you only want to import only the tags, you can go to "Import Tags" > "From a .satchel file" in the "Tags" Tab.
    - If you only want to import the items without any tags, you can select "From a .satchel file" in the "Add Books" Tab.
  - You can find more info about the new .satchel file format [here](https://github.com/DSPaul/COMPASS/tree/master/Docs/Satchels.md).
- You can now merge collections. This is especially handy when used in combination with import. If you would like to browse a collection you wish to import before merging it into your existing collections, you can simply import it as a new collection and merge it later.
- Added a new context menu to the tags tab which can be accessed by right clicking anywhere or clicking the vertical triple dots, with the following options
  - Sort tags A->Z. [#31](https://github.com/DSPaul/COMPASS/issues/31)
  - Export Tags.
- Importing from a folder now allows you to exclude certain subfolders. [#58](https://github.com/DSPaul/COMPASS/issues/58)

### Improvements

- Tags created using "quick new tag" are now automatically added to the item being edited.
- COMPASS now saves more often to prevent data loss.
- Info and warning tooltips now appear instantly.
- Added an explainer when zero-padding is applied to the sorting title.
- When auto import tries to import a new file type, it will now always ask what to do with it.
- Increased stability.
- When manually resolving a broken file reference, COMPASS will analyze how the file path changed and attempt to fix other broken links by applying the same change.

### Fixes

- Fixed tags being cleared when quick creating a tag.
- Fix total item count not updating.
- Cards in Card Layout can now resize thanks to an update to the [VirtualizingWrapPanel](https://github.com/sbaeumlisberger/VirtualizingWrapPanel) package. (thanks [@sbaeumlisberger](https://github.com/sbaeumlisberger)) This fixes [#62](https://github.com/DSPaul/COMPASS/issues/62)
- Fix metadata source priority preferences not persisting.

## COMPASS v1.6.0 (6 November 2023)

### Features

- You can now import Tags from other collections [#51](https://github.com/DSPaul/COMPASS/issues/51). This new way of adding tags to a collection can be found in the slightly redesigned Tags Tab, next to creating new tags and tag groups. 

### Improvements

- The "Update Found" window now displays the COMPASS logo rather than the AutoUpdater.NET logo.
- Flipped the webcam preview when scanning IBAN barcodes so it mirrors your movements making it much easier to align.
- Titles that contain numbers will now sort as expected ("book-1","book-2","book-10" instead of "book-1","book-10","book-2").
- Improved changelog display when update is found.
- Make the UI to add a folder to check for auto import more intuitive.
- Various improvements to author selection, including [#46](https://github.com/DSPaul/COMPASS/issues/46)
- Renamed "Delete" To "Remove" to clarify that items are removed from COMPASS and no user files are deleted in the process.

## COMPASS v1.5.1 (20 August 2023)

### Fixes

- Fixed a crash when finishing the "choose metadata wizard"
- Fixed a crash during search when there are items with empty titles

## COMPASS v1.5.0 (20 May 2023)

### New Features

- Added a priority system for metadata sources so you can choose which metadata values should be used when multiple sources can provide data for a certain field. This also applies to the thumbnail and cover of books. You can configure the priority in the new `Metadata` tab in the settings. [#52](https://github.com/DSPaul/COMPASS/issues/52)
- Added the option to renew metadata for items in your collections. This way you can get metadata for files already in your collections making use of all the new features, metadata fields and sources that may not have existed when the file was initially imported. The new system will search for metadata in all of the item's sources (a local file, a URL and ISBN number) and combine them using the previously added priority order and overwrite the old value with the new one according to your preferences which you can also configure in the new `Metadata` tab in the settings.
- Added "Has ISBN" filter.
- Added "Website" filter.
- Added "Show in Open Library" button next to the ISBN number.
- Added a new entry in the context menu (right click) to renew the cover, to complement the one to renew metadata. [#54](https://github.com/DSPaul/COMPASS/issues/54)
- Add "Date Added" & "ISBN" column to List Layout. [#55](https://github.com/DSPaul/COMPASS/issues/55)
- Added the options to cancel background tasks. 
  
### Improvements

- Added virtualization for large collections which massively improves load times at the cost of some small stutters while scrolling. Because of this trade-off, the collection's size at which virtualization is enabled can be configured in the `Preferences` tab of the settings. [#22](https://github.com/DSPaul/COMPASS/issues/22)
- Various improvements to the `Card Layout` including faster rendering, more responsive resizing and clearer icons.
There is a know issue where the bottom of a card might get cut off if it has many tags, this will get fixed when the [Virtualizing WrapPanel](https://github.com/sbaeumlisberger/VirtualizingWrapPanel) dependecy updates to 2.0.
- The progressbar at the bottom is now used for more things, giving better insight into what COMPASS is doing in the background.
- The import procedure has been split up in three steps: adding all the files, getting metadata for those files, and finally getting the cover for them. This is in constrast to previous versions where these three steps would be done for one file, before moving on to the next one. The new method significantly speeds up import for large imports and makes is less likely to lose your data if the import is interupted.
- The "Fetch Cover" button in the edit window has been renamed to "renew" and will now look for covers in the order specified by the new priority system.

### Fixes

- UI elements that can become scrollable will no longer prevent scrolling when they are not scrollable yet themselves.
- COMPASS no longer freezes when reading in files during import.
- Fixed COMPASS using empty covers form openlibrary.org.
- Fixed broken ISBN detection in pdf's in some cases.
- Files with capitalized file extensions will now be handled properly.
- Fix progress counter having the wrong value.
- Various other small fixes.

- A new "Delete Forever" option was added which prevents files from automatically being imported again, which is intended to complement the new automatic import feature.
- You can manage both the folders to check for new files and the list of banished (deleted forever) files in the new `sources` tab of the settings.
- Added a new ribbon along the bottom with extra info such as:
  - How many files are present in a collection and how many of them match all the filters. [#39](https://github.com/DSPaul/COMPASS/issues/39)
  - Progress indication when tasks are running in the background.
